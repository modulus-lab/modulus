# Modulus - Supercharge your mocks

Modulus is mocking on steroids. It is a powerful tool designed to solve the problem of test data,
static users and mocking complex user journeys. 

With Modulus, you can create dynamic mocks that can be easily configured and managed. It allows you to
simulate real-world scenarios, making it easier to test and develop applications. It provides you with a 
permutation and combination of responses across chained APIs, enabling you to create complex user journeys with ease.

## Features
Modulus is currently in active development, and we are continuously adding new features to enhance its capabilities. 
Some of the key features include:

- Dynamic Mocking: Create dynamic mocks that can be easily configured and managed.
- API Chaining: Simulate complex user journeys by chaining multiple APIs together.
- Real-world Scenarios: Test and develop applications in a simulated environment that mimics real-world
- HTTP Methods Support: Supports various HTTP methods including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- Easy Configuration: Simple and intuitive configuration options for setting up mocks.

## Getting Started
